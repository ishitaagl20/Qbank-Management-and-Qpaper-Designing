# Qbank-Management-and-Qpaper-Designing

The project links MySQL, Python and Text files. It is 
based on the management of a question bank. The 
second feature of the project is the designing of a 
question paper, wherein it extracts questions from 
the database and finally displays them in the form 
of a text file. The user can open the text file with 
Microsoft word and find the basic question paper 
ready.
The project allows the user to append questions in 
the database and to view them from the database. 
For designing the question paper, it asks the paper 
setter for a few basic details about the examination 
and the number of questions. Then, all the user has 
to is to enter the chapter number and the marks for 
each question to get the question paper ready in the 
form of a text file.
It can be further elaborated for a huge a quantum of 
data, for the question bank of several classes and 
several subjects. It can have many more user
friendly functions such as helping the user in 
deciding the weightage of each chapter and diving 
it in different type of questions.
